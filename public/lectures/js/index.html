        <p>Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
            You know that I caught it
            Bad, bad boy
            Shiny toy with a price
            You know that I bought it
            Killing me slow, out the window
            I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
            Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
            What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
            And it's new, the shape of your body
            It's blue, the feeling I've got
            And it's ooh, whoa, oh
            It's a cruel summer
            It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
            No rules in breakable heaven
            But ooh, whoa oh
            It's a cruel summer
            With you
            Hang your head low
            In the glow of the vending machine
            I'm not dying
            You say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
            We're not trying
            </p>
